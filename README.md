# ECDH-with-PMNS
This repository contains an implementation of Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH), with arithmetic operations performed in PMNS. 
<br />
The implementation is done using the SageMath library http://www.sagemath.org/.
<br />
<br />
The file 'EC_Diffie-Hellman.py' shows how to run the ECDH protocol.
